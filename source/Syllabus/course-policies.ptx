        <p>
            Attendance in class sessions makes up 7.5% of your total grade; it will be recorded by the teaching team on Canvas during each of our sessions after shopping period. 

Each student will be provided one week's worth of personal days (3 sessions for MWF folk; 2 sessions for TTh folk) to use for absences of any kind. Absences other than these personal days will not be excused. If you are ill for a long period of time, please contact your instructor to come up with a plan to keep you on pace for the term.
