# Linear Algebra for Team-Based Inquiry Learning

Materials for teaching linear algebra using
Team-Based Inquiry Learning, authored in
[PreTeXt](https://pretextbook.org/). This is a part of the
[TBIL Resource Library](https://sites.google.com/southalabama.edu/tbil). This work was
funded by the National Science Foundation [DUE #2011807](https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2011807).

[Steven Clontz](https://clontz.org) and
[Drew Lewis](http://drew-lewis.com) are the maintainers
of this project.

## Getting started

These materials are hosted at
<https://teambasedinquirylearning.github.io/linear-algebra/>.

Other materials, such as quizzes for the Readiness Assurance Process,
are available in the PDF folder of this repository, with updated versions
available by joining the TBIL Slack community. Learn more at
[TBIL.org](http://tbil.org).

## Copyright and Licensing

See [source/meta/copyright.ptx](source/meta/copyright.ptx).

## Authoring

First install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/). Then do
the following to install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

```
$ python -V
Python 3.9.0
$ python -m pip install pip --upgrade
$ python -m pip install pipenv
```

Then the following steps will clone a copy of this book's
source and install the appropriate version of the
[PreTeXt CLI](https://github.com/PreTeXtBook/pretext-cli).

```
$ git clone git@github.com:TeamBasedInquiryLearning/linear-algebra.git tbil-la
$ cd tbil-la
$ python -m pipenv install
$ python -m pipenv run pretext --version
[displays the version specified in `Pipfile`]
```

The PreTeXt source may be found in the `source` folder and
edited as follows:

```
# Run this to start the authoring environment
$ python -m pipenv shell

# To build HTML from updated source
$ pretext build

# To preview the built HTML in your browser
$ pretext view

# To publish the latest build to GitHub pages
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "useful description of update"
$ pretext publish

# To exit the authoring environment
$ exit
```

Use `pretext --help` for documentation of other pretext CLI features.

## Building slides

Right now slide building isn't part of PreTeXt CLI, so here's how to do it.

First, clone a copy of https://github.com/rbeezer/mathbook into the folder `slides/pretext`.

Then the following line will create a PreTeXt slideshow (run from project root).

```
xsltproc --xinclude -o slides/slides.ptx slides/extract-slides.xsl source/main.ptx
```

And the following line will build that slideshow into a Reveal.js HTML file.

```
xsltproc --xinclude -o output/html/slides.html slides/pretext/xsl/pretext-revealjs.xsl slides/slides.ptx
```

- For convenience, the following line does a `pretext build` and also builds slides in one step:

  ```
  pretext build; xsltproc --xinclude -o slides/slides.ptx slides/extract-slides.xsl source/main.ptx; xsltproc --xinclude -o output/html/slides.html slides/pretext/xsl/pretext-revealjs.xsl slides/slides.ptx
  ```
  
- Or run this if you also need to rebuild `latex-image` diagrams:

  ```
  pretext build -d; xsltproc --xinclude -o slides/slides.ptx slides/extract-slides.xsl source/main.ptx; xsltproc --xinclude -o output/html/slides.html slides/pretext/xsl/pretext-revealjs.xsl slides/slides.ptx
  ```

This slideshow may be previewed with `pretext view`, and will be published with
the rest of the HTML content.
